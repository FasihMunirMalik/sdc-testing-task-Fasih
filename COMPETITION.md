# Competition Overview

## Test Selection
*Test Selection* is the process of picking only the relevant test cases from the test suite for a particular change.
In the context of simulation-based testing for SDCs with long running test cases, we select test cases fulfilling certain constraints:
- *Time Budget*: TODO
- *Fault Detection*: TODO
- *Diversity*: TODO

## Goal
The participants of the tool competition submit a test selector for simulation-based tests.
Specifically, the participants implement the predefined interfaces provide by the tool competition platform.
